# Distributed-Intelligence-Model-for-IoT-Applications

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 

This work proposes a model that provides an IoT gateway with  the  intelligence needed  to  extract  the knowledge from sensorsâ€™ data in order to make the decision locally without needing to send all raw data to the cloud over the Internet.  When the gateway is unable to process a task locally, the data and task are offloaded to the cloud.

## Model Demonstration
The model was demonstrated by building smart home distributed intelligence application. 
The Model architecture is presented below:

## The features of the smart home distributed intelligence application:
* Controll home appliences using machine learning.
* Local data processing of the most real time data for fast decision and action making.
* Offload coming tasks when the gateway is overload. 
* Avoid sending most of the data to the cloud for security and privacy purposes.
* Enable IoT network to be more resourceful in terms of energy and communication bandwidth.

* IoT gateway: Raspberry Pi,  zigbee usb.
* End devices: smart plug, smart bulb, motion sensor, temperature sensor, and two mobile phones.

## Collect the data from sensors:

</p>

* ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). 


## Cloud platforms:
* IBM cloud.

## Build Neural Networks algorithm that able to controll the home appliences : 
* Programming: 
 * Python ( NumPy, Pandas, Keras, Matplotlib)
 * Neural Networks (MLPNN, LSTM, and GRUs)
 * Node-Red
 * JSON
 * Java Script
 * train the choosen Neural Networks algorithm on the collected data. 
 * save the model in .h5 file in order to use it for controlling home appliences.

# Build flow-based tool using Node-Red that connects end devices, gateway, and cloud.
* Include the trained Neural Networks algorithm (.h5) in the Node-Red tool.
* When any event happen at the house, the system will response to the event based on Neural Networks trained model that is implemented on Node-Red.
  

# The application now knows when to turn the light on/off:
* Suppose the collected dataset illusrats that you usually go to the bed at 9:00PM on weekdays and 1:00AM on weekends.
  * The appliaction will turn the light off 9:00PM on weekdays. 
  * The appliaction will turn the light off 1:00AM on weekends.
