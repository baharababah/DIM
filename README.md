# Distributed-Intelligence-Model-for-IoT-Applications

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 

This work proposes a model that provides an IoT gateway with  the  intelligence needed  to  extract  the knowledge from sensorsâ€™ data in order to make the decision locally without needing to send all raw data to the cloud over the Internet.  When the gateway is unable to process a task locally, the data and task are offloaded to the cloud.

## Model Demonstration
The model was demonstrated by building smart home distributed intelligence application. 
The Model architecture is presented below:

## The features of the smart home distributed intelligence application:
* Controll home appliences using machine learning.
* Local data processing of the most real time data for fast decision and action making.
* Offload coming tasks when the gateway is overload. 
* Avoid sending most of the data to the cloud for security and privacy purposes.
* Enable IoT network to be more resourceful in terms of energy and communication bandwidth.


## Hardware
* IoT gateway: Raspberry Pi,  zigbee usb.
* End devices: smart plug, smart bulb, motion sensor, temperature sensor, and two mobile phones.

## Cloud platforms:
* IBM cloud.

## Programming
* Python ( NumPy, Pandas, Keras, Matplotlib)
* Node-Red
* JSON
* Java Script

## Neural Networks
* MLPNN
*LSTM
*GRUs
